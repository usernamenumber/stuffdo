# WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a helper script to take results from a Google form with two axes of information about people:

- Interest levels in a set of potential events
- Availability for a set of potential dates

The idea is to suggest optimal combinations of events + dates that would allow the most people with the most interest to attend.

So far it is far from ready for prime time, though it did get the job done for the bout of scheduling for which it was designed. It lives here so I know where the code is when I have a chance to pick it up again.
